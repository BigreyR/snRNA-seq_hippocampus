Deciphering molecular heterogeneity and dynamics of neural stem cells in human hippocampal development, aging, and injury

This site provides the analysis codes to generate the figures reported in the published paper "Deciphering molecular heterogeneity and dynamics of human hippocampal neural stem cells at different ages and injury states" available on elife at https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/89507.

While accumulated publications support the existence of neurogenesis in the adult human hippocampus, the homeostasis and developmental potentials of neural stem cells (NSCs) under different contexts remain unclear. Based on our generated single-nucleus atlas of the human hippocampus across neonatal, adult, aging and injury, we dissected the molecular heterogeneity and transcriptional dynamics of human hippocampal NSCs under different contexts. We further identified new specific neurogenic lineage markers that overcome the lack of specificity found in some well-known markers. Based on developmental trajectory and molecular signatures, we found that a subset of NSCs exhibit quiescent properties after birth, and most NSCs become deep quiescence during aging. Furthermore, certain deep quiescent NSCs are re-activated following stroke injury. Together, our findings provide valuable insights into the development, aging, and re-activation of the human hippocampal NSCs, and help to explain why adult hippocampal neurogenesis is infrequently observed in humans.
